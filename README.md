## 🚀 Quick Installation

### Windows

**Option 1: One-Click Install (Recommended)**
```cmd
install.bat
```

**Option 2: Manual Install**
```cmd
pip install sympy
python Automated-Matrix-Inverter.py
```

---

### macOS / Linux

**Option 1: One-Click Install (Recommended)**
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual Install**
```bash
# Install tkinter if not present (Linux only)
# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# Fedora:
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

# macOS (tkinter comes with Python from python.org or brew)
brew install python-tk

# Install dependencies and run
pip3 install sympy
python3 Automated-Matrix-Inverter.py
```

## 📦 Dependencies

All dependencies are automatically installed by the installation scripts.

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `sympy` | Symbolic mathematics library for matrix operations |
| `tkinter` | GUI framework (built into Python) |

---

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Launch the application** using the install script or manually
2. **Select matrix size** (2×2 to 10×10) from the dropdown
3. **Click "Generate Matrix"** to create the input grid
4. **Enter values** in each cell (supports numbers, fractions like `1/2`, or variables like `a`, `b`)
5. **Click "Calculate"** to compute the inverse
6. **View results** showing the original matrix and its inverse
7. **Toggle format** between fractions and decimals using the button
8. **Review operations** in the right panel showing all Gauss-Jordan steps

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sympy'` | Run `pip install sympy` or use the install script |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tkinter'` | Install tkinter for your OS (see installation section) |
| Matrix has no inverse | The matrix is singular (determinant = 0) |
| Window appears incorrectly | Try toggling the theme button (bottom-right corner) |
